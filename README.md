# Whatsapp translator web-client chrome extension

This is small chrome extension we use for the whatsapp web-client to translate incoming messages and translate our messages with ChatGPT's API.
It's used internally, but I've made this repo public for others to fork or use. 

It's very barebones, but definitely works (atleast for us).
When the extension is active, some js will be loaded and it'll add buttons to messags.
